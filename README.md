# MistyMountain

A misty theme for SDDM

## Why build this?

I wanted to get some experience with Tiling Window Managers and see that sddm is a common part of lots of toolbelt of others that have been in the game for a while.

 I like the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) style-guide and wanted something nice looking for my login screen, plus <a class="d-inline-block" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/ChrisTitusTech/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/"><img class="avatar avatar-user" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7896101?s=80&amp;v=4" width="30" height="30" alt="@ChrisTitusTech"></a> is working on a sweet OS that I am using, so easy decision.

 I wanted to keep this minimal so no user picture
